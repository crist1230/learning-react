80. when you see package-lock.json it's basically storing all the versions of
    things you wouldn't want to be messed with when you share your git repo

79. The parameter you put into the component anonymous function will always be
    "props" which is any attribute you include when you call the component

        ex:
        
            const Directory = ( props ) => {
                return (
                    <div className='directory-container'>
                    {props.categories.map((category) => (
                        <CategoryItem key={category.id} category={category} /*these are props*/ />  
                    ))} 
                    </div> 
                );
            };
