what is "export default"
    basically, if we have a file that has got one thing to export, then we can use a shorthand
    when we are importing the file (look at the link for a side by side comparison of when
    export defaut vs export is used)

ROUTES
    you can have multiple routes that return the same element, but not that the path may be different
    if you have the routes nested in other routes

    Here's a sandbox to play with:
    https://codesandbox.io/s/optimistic-northcutt-vjckot?file=/src/App.js

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <Routes>
            <Route path='/' element={<Navigation />}>
                <Route index element={<Home />} />
                <Route path='shop' element={<Shop />} /> {/* this is just saying that theres a
                path to /shop and when there's an attempt to access it, show the Shop element. And
                cuz this is a child of a route, the parent route (navigation) will show up no
                matter if you change the path to anything else. This does not make a link to shop 
                magically appear, you have to write that code in the place where you want it to 
                appear. In this case, you would write the code in the navigation element. */}
            </Route>
            </Routes>
        );
    };
